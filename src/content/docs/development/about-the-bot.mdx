## Understanding GitHub Apps and Local Development

### What is a GitHub App?

A GitHub App is how bots interact with GitHub. It's:

- **An account** - GitHub knows "this is the AllContributors bot"
- **A permission system** - defines what the bot can read/write (issues, PRs,
  files)
- **A webhook endpoint** - where GitHub sends events (like "someone commented
  on an issue")

When someone comments `@all-contributors please add @user for code`, GitHub
sends that comment as a webhook to whatever URL is configured in the GitHub App
settings.

### Why create your own test app?

The production AllContributors app is configured to send webhooks to the
production Vercel deployment. You can't use it for local development because:

1. The webhooks go to production, not your laptop
2. Your changes would affect real repositories
3. You'd need to deploy every change just to test it

### Local development flow:

1. **Create your own GitHub App** - your personal copy with its own settings
2. **Point its webhooks at your local machine** - so events come to you
3. **Install it only on test repos** - isolated from production
4. **Run the bot code locally** - make changes, test immediately
5. **When ready** - deploy to Vercel and test with preview deployments

This gives you a safe sandbox to develop in.
