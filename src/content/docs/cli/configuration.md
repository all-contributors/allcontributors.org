The CLI reads its settings from your `.all-contributorsrc` file, the same
configuration file used by the bot.

Some of the most important fields for the CLI are:

* `projectOwner` and `projectName`, which tell the CLI which repository to
  use when it talks to GitHub or GitLab
* `files`, which lists the files where contributor tables and badges live
* `imageSize`, `commit`, and other options that control how contributors are
  displayed and whether commits are made automatically

For a complete description of all available options, please refer to the
[bot configuration documentation](/bot/configuration).
