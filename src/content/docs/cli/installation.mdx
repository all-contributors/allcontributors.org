## How to install the All-Contributors CLI tool

The all-contributors CLI module is distributed via
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which is bundled with
[node](https://nodejs.org/) and should be installed as one of your
project's `devDependencies`.

To install it run:

```console
npm i -D all-contributors-cli
# If you are a yarn user: yarn add --dev all-contributors-cli
```

Alternatively, Arch Linux users can install the
[`all-contributors-cli`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/all-contributors-cli)
package from the AUR.

<Aside type="tip">
The CLI is node-based. If you do not wish to add a Node dependency, use
the [@all-contributors bot 🤖](/bot/overview).
</Aside>

## 2. Initialize the cli

To initialize your project to use the all-contributors cli, you can run
`all-contributors init`. The `init` command will create a `.all-contributorsrc`
file in the root of your project and will ask you how you wish to configure
your project to use the cli.

```console
npx all-contributors init
# Or with yarn: yarn all-contributors init

# Or directly execute the bin
./node_modules/.bin/all-contributors init
```

When you run `all-contributors init`, The cli will ask you a few questions
to help you configure your project:

```console
npx all-contributors-cli init
? What's the name of the repository? all-contributors
? Who is the owner of the repository? all-contributors
? What is the repository type? GitHub
? Where is the repository hosted? Hit Enter if it's on GitHub or GitLab https://github.com
? In which file should contributors be listed? README.md
? Do you want a badge tallying the number of contributors? Yes
? In which file should the badge be shown? README.md
? How big should the avatars be? (in px) 75
? Do you want this badge to auto-commit when contributors are added? Yes
? What commit convention would you want it to use? Angular
? Do you want to add a footer with link to usage? Yes
```


## 3. How to add a contributor

To add a contributor to your project, you can run `all-contributors add`
followed by the contributor's username and the contributions they have made.

```console
npx all-contributors add jfmengels doc
```

The `add` command will add a contributor to your project and will ask you
how they have contributed to your project.

## 4. Update your contributing documentation

Consider updating your `CONTRIBUTING.md` or similar with steps on how your
contributors can add themselves. You can even link to the
[CLI usage documentation](/cli/usage).

## 5. *Optionally* add shortcut scripts to your `package.json`

You can optionally add shortcuts to your commands in your `package.json`
`scripts` field.

For example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "contributors:add": "all-contributors add",
    "contributors:generate": "all-contributors generate"
  }
}
```

To support shortcuts such as:

```console
npx contributors:add jfmengels doc
```
