## About the Emoji Table

To have a contribution added when using the [Bot](../bot/overview) or [CLI](../cli/overview) use the keyword in the `Type` column.

For example if you add a comment in an issue or Pull Request on GitHub like this:

`@all-contributors add @usernamehere for a11y`

Then the bot will add the user (usernamehere) as a contributor with the `Accessibility` contribution type to your project's README file.
You can also use multiple contribution types like this:

`@all-contributors add @usernamehere for a11y, docs, infra`

And the bot will add those contribution types to the user's existing contribution types. If the user is not already a contributor, the bot will add them as a new contributor with those contribution types.

### Natural Language Processing

The bot will use [basic Natural Language Parsing](https://github.com/all-contributors/app/blob/main/lib/parse-comment.js) to determine your contribution intent.
